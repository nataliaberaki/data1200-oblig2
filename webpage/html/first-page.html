                                NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and two Russian crewmates parachuted to a landing on the remote steppe of Kazakhstan on Wednesday, capping a 371-day mission at the International Space Station, the longest single spaceflight ever undertaken by an American.

                It was also the third-longest mission off the planet in the history of human spaceflight, eclipsed only by two Russian cosmonauts who lived on the Mir space station in the 1990s.

                Rubio, a US
                Rubio, a US Army lieutenant colonel who grew up in El Salvador and Miami, was supposed to spend about six months in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station. He launched on September 21, 2022, on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft with commander Sergey Prokopyev and flight engineer Dmitri Petelin.

                Three months into Rubio's mission, the Soyuz spacecraft he rode into orbit suddenly started leaking coolant. Russian engineers determined the leak was most likely caused by an impact from a tiny fragment of rock from deep space, called a micrometeoroid, which ruptured a coolant line and sent a spray of snowflake-like particles into space as the Soyuz remained docked at the station.

                Russian space officials decided it was too risky to have the crippled Soyuz spacecraft return to Earth as planned with its three-man crew, so they launched a replacement Soyuz to the station in February without anyone on board. That meant the crew originally assigned to fly on that spacecraft got bumped until the next Soyuz would be ready to launch in September.

                Hugs in Houston

                                Rubio's mission spanned 5,936 orbits of the Earth and covered more than 157 million miles (253 million kilometers). He was expected to board a NASA jet in Kazakhstan for the flight back to Houston, where he will reunite with his family.

                “Hugging my wife and kids is going to be paramount, and I’ll probably focus on that for the first couple of days," Rubio said. He added that he's looking forward to the "peace and quiet" of his backyard. "Up here, we kind of have the constant hum of machinery that’s keeping us alive.”

                Like Petelin, this was Rubio's first flight to space. Rubio was an Army physician and a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter pilot before NASA selected him to join the agency's astronaut corps in 2017. His medical training gave him an idea of what to expect as he re-adapts to Earth's gravity after floating around in orbit for more than a year

                                Astronauts on the space station follow a strict exercise regimen to counteract the loss of bone and muscle mass due to microgravity. Eyesight degrades in some astronauts flying in space, and research has shown spaceflight can diminish the effectiveness of the immune system. Many astronauts feel sick for a couple of days after reaching space and again after returning to Earth.

                Rubio said last week he expects it to take two to six months to fully re-adapt to Earth's gravity.

                Scientists will closely track how Rubio responds to Earth's gravity over the coming days and weeks. More than 600 people have flown in space, but only seven humans have logged a year off the planet on a single mission, a list that nearly doubled with the yearlong expedition that ended Wednesday.
